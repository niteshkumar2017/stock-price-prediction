📈 Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how to use Machine Learning (Regression) techniques to predict future stock prices based on historical market data.
The model is trained on stock closing prices and generates trend forecasting for upcoming days.

⚠️ Note: This project is for educational purposes only. Stock market prices are highly volatile and influenced by many factors (news, global events, investor behavior). Do not use this as a financial trading tool.

🚀 Features

Load and preprocess historical stock market data.

Train a Linear Regression model on closing price trends.

Predict stock prices for future days.

Visualize actual vs predicted prices with graphs.

Forecast next 30 days stock price trend.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Seaborn

📈 Future Improvements

Use LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models for better time-series forecasting.

Add multiple features (Open, High, Low, Volume) for more accurate predictions.

Deploy the model as a Flask/Django web app.

Automate data fetching using Yahoo Finance API.
